# PWA (Progressive Web Application)
PWA offers a user mobile experience similar to a native app (installing the app on the mobile home screen; accessing the app offline; push notifications)  
It is cheaper than native apps.  
**PWA contributes to Search Engine Optimization (SEO); it is possible – with tools from Google – to test how your PWA scores in the search results; important factors here are the safety (do you use https?) and the loading time of a PWA.**
