### debug: (in terminal) node test.js  
Note: JavaScript is not the same as node.js  
Eg. require() is not a part of JavaScript standard and is not supported by browsers out of the box, it is the node.js module system.
### console.log():
* used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user (output a message to the web console)
* Parameters -- accept an array, an object or any message
### body tag's onload callback attribute specifies 
* the provided randomizeButtonPositions method should be called right after the body of your html page has finished loading
