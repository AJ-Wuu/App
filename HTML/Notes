HTML is NOT Case Sensitive
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>
Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

Beginning:
    <html lang="en"></html>
        Always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page.

Title:
    <p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
        The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

Headings (<h1> to <h6>):
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>
    <h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
        Even bigger headers â†‘
    
Paragraphs:
    <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
        The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
    <hr> <- Defines a thematic change in the content
    <br> <- Inserts a single line break
    <pre> <- Defines pre-formatted text

Links:
    <a href="https://www.ajwuu.com">Name of the link shown in text</a>
        The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

Images:
    <img src="ajwuu.jpg" alt="this is an alternative text" width="104" height="142">
        The required alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.
        This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

        lynx <filename>
