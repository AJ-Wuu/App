Benefits of using Angular:
1. Give the applications a clean structure
2. Include a lot of re-usable code
3. Make the applications more testable

Preparation Process:
>ng new hello-world
>cd hello-world
>code .
>ng serve

Browser does not refresh after code changes: >npm install --save @ngtools/webpack@1.2.4
Browser does not automatically open after "ng serve" (should open http://localhost:4200/): >ng serve --open

Use "ctrl + backtick" (backtick is the one before "1!") to open a command window within VSCode
